    <pre align="justify">         Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent
        of the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive.
         Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system.
        Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature. 

       
    Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in
                       the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. Irrespective of what
                       nature provides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.</pre>
